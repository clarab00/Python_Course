Afenmai;Afenmai;New York's Nigerian population started growing in the 1970s and 80s, accelerating since 2000 in part thanks to the Diversity Visa program. Nigerians from a wide variety of backgrounds—though a significant percentage are middle-class and highly educated— now make up a large percentage of the city's massive West African community, particularly in East New York, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Flatbush, Clifton, and Concourse. Numerous evangelical churches now serve Christian Nigerian New Yorkers, and there are a number of restaurants, markets, and other businesses for the wider community. Community and hometown organizations also represent those with ties to particular Nigerian states like Edo and Akwa Ibom. The multilingualism of Nigerian New Yorkers testifies to the country's extraordinary linguistic diversity, though Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, and Edo varieties appear to be the most common, with Nigerian English sometimes a lingua franca. Smaller language groups are also present, including some with substantial and well-organized communities: Afenmai, Anaang, Edo, Efik, Esan, Ibibio, Kalabari, Tiv, Urhobo, and likely others.;Western Africa;Nigeria;270000;Castle Hill;;4.082.852.200;-7.385.773.100;Smallest;Residential;afen1234;Atlantic-Congo;ets
African-American English;Black English;African-American life in Brooklyn dates back to the days when it was an independent city centered on what is today Downtown Brooklyn, but with vast rural and small-town hinterlands devoted to farming. Slavery persisted into the first decades of the 19th century, longer than elsewhere in New York (and in the North more generally). Weeksville, a free Black community, grew up near today's Crown Heights and Bed-Stuy neighborhoods partly in the wake of the devastating Draft Riots of 1863, which drove many Black people from Manhattan. More recently, the movement of a growing African-American community out of overcrowded Harlem after the Second World War led to tremendous growth in Black Brooklyn. By the 1960s and 70s, Bed-Stuy and the surrounding neighborhoods had become a major center of African-American life, culture, and politics, with figures ranging from Shirley Chisholm to Spike Lee to the Notorious B.I.G. all making their mark.;Northern America;United States;45109521;Bedford-Stuyvesant;Ocean Hill-Brownsville, East New York;4.068.722.900;-7.393.257.100;Largest;Residential;;Indo-European;eng

Africans of diverse backgrounds were part of the fabric of New Amsterdam (and later New York) from the earliest stages. Many would have been multilingual and maintained some use of their native languages even in the city, though little about this is known in any detail. In the Dutch period, many enslaved Africans brought to New York were Kikongo speakers from the Kingdom of Kongo or Kimbundu-speaking Ndongo.

By 1918, in the wake of the Ottoman Empire's collapse, Aromanians had became a marginalized minority within Greece, Bulgaria, Albania, and what became Yugoslavia.

Aromanian;Vlach;Aromanians, sometimes also known as Vlachs (or historically as Macedo-Romanians), are speakers of Eastern Romance language varieties living across the Balkan peninsula from Romania to Greece. They idenify variously, including some as descending from ancient Macedonians or Romans, and others as part of different national groups. By 1918, in the wake of the Ottoman Empire's collapse, Aromanians had became a marginalized minority within Greece, Bulgaria, Albania, and what became Yugoslavia.

Originally spoken around 1500 BCE and thus an important linguistic key to the Indo-European past, Avestan was revitalized as a written-only liturgical language nearly two thousand years later. Named for Zoroastrianism's central text, the Avesta, the language employed a new alphabet that descends to an extent from (Semitic) Aramaic, though linguistically it is closer to (Indo-European) Sanskrit. In daily life, Zoroastrians from Iran may speak Zoroastrian Dari (closely related to Persian), while those from South Asia (notably Parsis) may speak Gujarati or English, but Avestan continues to serve as a common liturgical language for worshippers at the Dar-e-Mehr Zoroastrian Temple in Pomona, New York.;Southern Asia;India, Iran;;Pomona (NY);;4.116.845.900;-7.405.239.800;Medium;Liturgical;aves1237;Indo-European;ave

Breton;Brezhoneg;Immigration from Brittany, the region of northwest France where this Celtic language is spoken, grew substantially in the early 20th century and reached its peak between the two world wars. During this time the majority of French immigrants in New York City may have been Breton, with several thousand having come to work at Michelin Tire Corporation's factory in Milltown, New Jersey, or otherwise after the Second World War as waiters, dishwashers, busboys etc. at restaurants which often had Breton owners. By 1967, there were 12,000 Bretons in the city, representing over a third of the city's total French population, according to the newspaper France-Amerique. The linguist Kenneth Nilsen found that a number of restaurants were mainly Breton-speaking, with many originally from the Gourin-Roudaouallec-Langonned region and some claiming to have learned French only in NYC's French restaurants. Today, the Breton Association of New York (BZH-NY) still has a large membership and continues to hold cultural events on a regular basis. A newer organization, Breizh Amerika, builds transnational ties between Bretons in Brittany and those in the city, who now number 2-3,000 at most according to the organization's founder Charles Kergaravat.

Bribri;Bribri;Bribri is a Chibchan language spoken by an estimated 11,000 people in the south of Costa Rica. Mainly living off hunting and subsistence agriculture, the Bribri represent the Indigenous population of the Costa Rica-Panama border area and still live in mountainous and coastal areas for the most part isolated from the general population. Three Chibchan dialects have been identified, identified by the Ethnologue as Amubre-Katsi, Coroma, or Salitre-Cabagra, or as belonging to two parts of Talamanca Canton and the area of Buenos Aires Canton. There are scattered speakers of Chibchan languages, including Birbri, living in the United States, but no known established communities. ELA has worked with construction worker Robert Elizondo and a friend of his, who were living in Paterson, New Jersey and are native speakers of the language. Among the texts recorded were descriptions of how to make chicha (a traditional corn-fermented alcohol) and how to make a blowgun for hunting.

Catalan;Català;Like most Spanish immigrants in the late 19th century, Catalans originally flocked to the West Village, alongside Asturians and Galicians. Most immigrated either directly from Catalonia or via Cuba, particularly after the latter became a U.S. territory in 1898 folloing the Spanish-American War. In 1920 (NY)C saw its first casal — a Catalonian government-funded society created to promote Catalan culture abroad. In the 1940s, a politically active casal grew from the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, transporting and promoting anti-Franco sentiment across the Atlantic. Today, one member of the Catalan community estimates that roughly 3,000 Catalans inhabit the metropolitan New York area, primarily in Manhattan and Brooklyn as well as New Jersey suburbs like Montclair and Maplewood.

Peak Danish immigration came in the second half of the 19th century, with many passing through the city on their way west, and others settling within the port-oriented world of Scandinavian Brooklyn that stretched from Red Hook to Bay Ridge.

Danube Swabian;Schwowisch;"Danube Swabians in the United States originally came from diverse transnational region like the Batschka and Banat in what is now principally Hungary, Romania, and Serbia. The Germanic variety they speak, linked to Swabian in southwest Germany, bears traces of many other surrounding languages. Like many other ethnic Germans of Eastern Europe, they were caught up in the turmoil of the Second World War and went as refugees to Germany and Austria, from which a substantial number came to the diversely Germanic neighborhood of Ridgewood, Queens, much as the Gottscheers did.

Darfurian Arabic;العربية دارفوري;Following genocidal campaigns by the government-backed Janjaweed militias in Sudan in the early 2000s, hundreds of thousands of Darfuri fled to refugee camps in Chad and, when possible, elsewhere. Of the much smaller number who made it as refugees to the U.S., most settled in Iowa and Indiana, from which several hundred left for a small Darfuri enclave in the Kensington section of Brooklyn. All the dozen or so Darfuri languages are giving way to what is now called Darfuri Arabic, which was already making inroads before the killings, but has also been the principal medium of communication among all kinds of Darfuris, in the refugee camps and in exile.

Dominican Creole (English);Dominican Creole (English);"The broad term Caribbean English refers to a whole range of Englishes — from highly distinctive creoles to ""acrolectal"" varieties close to other forms of English — spoken across much of the Caribbean. Beyond the varieties spoken by Jamaicans, Trinidadians, and Guyanese, which are the large Anglophone Caribbean communities in New York, there are also significant populations from Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Bahamas, Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and the Virgin Islands who have brought their own specific Caribbean cultures to the city. A Caribbean presence in the city goes back centuries, but larger waves started coming in the early 20th century and especially beginning in the 1950s. Today there are individuals from 17 English-speaking nations and territories, with the largest numbers in Brooklyn from Flatbush into Canarsie, but also in southeast Queens and the northeast Bronx.

Dominican Creole (French);Kwéyòl;The French colonial presence in the Caribbean resulted in the emergence of a number of related but distinct French-based creoles (or patois). Haitian Creole has by far the largest number of speakers in New York, followed by St. Lucian Creole, but a number of New Yorkers (mostly living in Brooklyn or Harlem) are also Creole speakers from Martinique, Guadeloupe, and French Guiana (all today still overseas departments of France). Today the local creoles are increasingly valued and studied, but metropolitan French nonetheless remains dominant. On nearby islands which were formerly under French rule (Trinidad and Tobago, Dominica, and Grenada) there are also small communities who have continued using French-based creoles, and it's possible that some individuals may be found in New York.;Caribbean;Dominica;43000;Flatbush;;4.064.059.563;-7.395.558.497;Smallest;Residential;;Indo-European;acf

French Guianese Creole;Kriyòl;The French colonial presence in the Caribbean resulted in the emergence of a number of related but distinct French-based creoles (or patois). Haitian Creole has by far the largest number of speakers in New York, followed by St. Lucian Creole, but a number of New Yorkers (mostly living in Brooklyn or Harlem) are also Creole speakers from Martinique, Guadeloupe, and French Guiana (all today still overseas departments of France). Today the local creoles are increasingly valued and studied, but metropolitan French nonetheless remains dominant. On nearby islands which were formerly under French rule (Trinidad and Tobago, Dominica, and Grenada) there are also small communities who have continued using French-based creoles, and it's possible that some individuals may be found in New York.;South America;French Guiana;300000;East Flatbush;;4.063.605.496;-7.395.079.755;Smallest;Residential;guia1246;Indo-European;gcr
Frisian;Frysk;North and West Frisian speakers were among the earliest settlers in the colony of New Amsterdam, possibly constituting, according to one source, the single largest ethnic group in the multicultural mix of early New Amsterdam. Peter Stuyvesant himself, the famous director general of the colony from 1647 to 1664, was born and raised in Friesland (part of the Dutch Republic) and would have been familiar with West Frisian. Others like Brooklyn settler Pieter Claessen (Wyckoff) were North Frisians. Frisian immigration resumed on a significant scale in the 19th century, with most going to the Midwest, but many West Frisians also passed through or stayed in New York or Paterson, New Jersey, forming social organizations with some ties to the Dutch-speaking community. North Frisians (more tied to the German community) came in large numbers to Brooklyn from the islands of Föhr and Amrum—1,500 Föhrer before 1929, for instance, who mostly spoke Fering and founded an association later headquartered in Valley Stream. Today, West Frisian is an official national language of the Netherlands along with Dutch and remains vital in its home territory, but North Frisian and Saterland Frisian, minority languages within Germany, have much smaller numbers of speakers. Among the German languages, the Frisian languages are the closest group linguistically to the Anglic group, of which English is a part.;Western Europe;Netherlands;470000;Financial District;;4.070.405.700;-7.401.317.900;Smallest;Historical;fris1239;Indo-European;fry

Fur;Bèle Fòòr;Following genocidal campaigns by the government-backed Janjaweed militias in Sudan in the early 2000s, hundreds of thousands of Darfuri fled to refugee camps in Chad and, when possible, elsewhere. Of the much smaller number who made it as refugees to the U.S., most settled in Iowa and Indiana, from which several hundred left for a small Darfuri enclave in the Kensington section of Brooklyn. All the dozen or so Darfuri languages are giving way to what is now called Darfuri Arabic, which was already making inroads before the killings, but has also been the principal medium of communication among all kinds of Darfuris, in the refugee camps and in exile.

German;Deutsch;German-speaking communities developed rapidly across Brooklyn in the mid-late 19th century, when it was still an independent city. From Brooklyn Heights to Bushwick, this included working-class areas for industrial workers as well as mansions in areas like Clinton Hill and Bedford-Stuyvesant for wealthy German-American entrepreneurs like Charles Pfizer, whose pharmaceuticals were manufactured in Williamsburg. Today the bilingual Zion German Evangelical Lutheran Church in Brooklyn Heights remains from that era while also welcoming more recent waves of German speakers who have settled in Brooklyn.;Western Europe;Germany, Austria, Switzerland;132176520;Brooklyn Heights;Bushwick, Williamsburg;4.069.679.000;-7.399.320.700;Small;Residential;stan1295;Indo-European;deu
German;Deutsch;Speakers of German language varieties were among the early colonists in New Amsterdam, but it was in the mid-19th century that New York became a German-language metropolis of tremendous scale and diversity rivaled only by Berlin and Vienna. Initially the hub was Kleindeutschland (Little Germany), today the East Village, especially in the vicinity of Tompkins Square Park. Among the largest regional linguistic groups, coming in waves after the uprisings of 1848, were the Prussians, the (Prussian-avoiding) Bavarians (including Palatines), Swabians, Wurttembergers, Hanoverians, and many others. Each group was concentrated to a degree in a different, neighboring East Side ward. There were 28 German-language newspapers around 1850, and still 12 German dailies in 1890, including some in regional languages like the Plattdeutsche Post (Low German) and Schwabbisches Wochenblatt (Swabian). The end of Kleindeutschland (Little Germany) is sometimes dated to the Slocum Disaster of 1904, in which over 1,000 people (primarily German-Americans) died, and the discrimination faced by German-Americans during the World Wars.;Western Europe;Germany, Austria, Switzerland;132176520;East Village;;4.072.709.200;-7.398.052.900;Largest;Historical;stan1295;Indo-European;deu

Gullah;Geechees;Gullah, a creole language with roots in English and various West and Central African languages, is spoken by Gullah-Geechee people predominately along the Southeast coast of the US, specifically the Sea Islands of Georgia and South Carolina. Many probably began arriving in New York with the Great Migration of African-Americans from those states in the first half of the 20th century, which also saw increasing displacement from the Sea Islands. In the late 1970s, CUNY linguist William A. Stewart documented the language with the help of New York's Gullah-speaking community, estimated to be 1,000 strong at the time. Prof. Stewart found Gullah-Geechee people hesitant to call their native tongue a proper language, and one goal of his work was to counter this sense of shame, common to speakers of oral languages, by validating Gullah's status as a language.

Hokkien;闽南话, Bân-lâm-gú;A large wave of working-class Fujianese speakers, especially from in and around the city of Fuzhou in China's Fujian Province, arrived in New York in the 1980s and 90s, after China loosened its emigration restrictions. At the time, Manhattan's Chinatown was dominated by Cantonese speakers from China's Guangdong Province, so Fujianese people settled in and around East Broadway, where Chinatown slowly expanded. Today, most Fujianese New Yorkers speak Mandarin as well and have spread across the city's Chinese neighborhoods, including Sunset Park, Bensonhurst, and Flushing. The Fujianese spoken in Fuzhou is also called Eastern Min, highlighting its connections to a wider group of related Sinitic languages. Also spoken to a lesser degree in New York are forms of Northern Min, from the northern part of Fujian: one example being several speakers from the area around Jianyang and Wuyishan, where neighboring villages may speak very differently. Forms of Southern Min are also related and to some extent heard in New York's Chinese neighborhoods, including Hainanese, Teochew, and Taiwanese — the latter also called Hokkien and widely spoken in the Southeast Asian Chinese diaspora.;Eastern Asia;China, Taiwan;50462190;Elmhurst;Chinatown;4.073.479.300;-7.387.853.200;Medium;Residential;taib1242;Sino-Tibetan;nan
Hopi;Hopílavayi;Ernest Naquayouma was a speaker of Hopi who played a pivotal role in documenting his own language, working closely with linguist Benjamin Whorf in the 1930s when Naquayouma was in New York. According to historian Robert Edwards, Naquayouma moved from Arizona to escape poverty and seek work in the city — like many on the Hopi Reservation past and present — and lived with his family at several addresses including this one in what was then a diverse working-class area, later completely redeveloped into Lincoln Center. Naquayouma and Whorf frequently worked together on Hopi both in New York City and in New Haven (Whorf was at Yale) and maintained a friendly correspondence. Traces of Naquayouma's life are hard to find, but he seems to have been a skilled artist who also toured with shows and spent time at a kind of summer camp at Indian Point near Peekskill, returning to Hopi territory when he could. Naquayouma later moved to Chicago, where he became an important early leader in that city's Urban Indian community.;Northern America;United States;6080;Lincoln Square;;4.077.533.300;-7.398.393.200;Smallest;Historical;hopi1249;Uto-Aztecan;hop
Hunanese;湘话;Most Chinese speakers in the city, from the first half of the 19th century until the second half of the 20th, spoke southern Chinese varieties, notably forms of Taishanese and Cantonese, but significant numbers of speakers of northern Chinese varieties including official Mandarin, began arriving especially after the Second World War. Many were from Taiwan and established a community in and around Flushing, where other Chinese immigrants from all over gradually joined them. Today, with the largest Chinese population outside of Asia, the entire metro area is home to an extraordinary variety of Sinitic (Chinese) languages even beyond the most widely spoken (Mandarin, Cantonese, Fujianese, Taishanese, Wenzhounese, Hakka). Some represent distinct but related varieties of these (e.g. Northern Fujianese, Taiwanese, Teochew, and Hainanese are all part of the Min group, with the Fuzhou variety of Fujianese by far the most common in New York) but others are highly distinct. Reports about other smaller Chinese languages communities in the city are scarce, but within the Mandarin subgroup there seem to be substantial numbers of speakers of Northeastern Mandarin and Sichuanese, and within the Wu subgroup substantial numbers of speakers of Shanghainese and Changzhounese. There are an unknown number of speakers of Gan (Jiangxi) and Xiang (Hunan) and probably many other varieties, likely not living as distinct communities, but within a larger Chinese matrix where Mandarin (as in China itself) is increasingly the lingua franca and valorized standard.;Eastern Asia;China;37300000;Flushing;;4.075.721.000;-7.382.685.100;Medium;Residential;xian1251;Sino-Tibetan;

Iyengar Tamil;ஐயங்கார்;Iyengar Tamil is a Tamil variety understood to have spread from the Tamil heartland to what is today the neighboring state of Karnataka, with the 11th century migration of a Brahmin community following the saint Ramanuja and his Sri Vaishnavist philosophy. The most common sub-dialects of Iyengar Tamil are those spoken by Hebbar and Mandyam Iyengars, which are substantially mutually intelligible. Showing influence from contact with Kannada, Iyengar Tamil is also distinctive in terms of its lexicon, especially its treatment of holy foods and items. Starting in the late 1970’s and 1980’s and peaking in the 1990’s and 2000’s, young professionals from the Iyengar diaspora community have been immigrating to the Greater New York area for improved job prospects and joining the burgeoning South Asian community, with some members in and around the hub of Edison.;Southern Asia;India;;Edison (NJ);;4.057.317.000;-7.434.543.600;Smallest;Residential;aiya1239;Dravidian;tam

Persian has become the principal language of communication, with literacy in the Persian script, and the younger generation shifting to English. Religious literature in the community, as in other Persian Jewish communities, was formerly in Judeo-Persian, a variety of Persian (not the Judeo-Shirazi vernacular) written in Hebrew script.

Judeo-Spanish;Ladino;Moving north with other Jews from the Lower East Side, Ladino speakers formed a distinct community in the Bronx beginning in the 1920s and 30s, with the greatest concentration around the Grand Concourse in the 160s. The Sephardic Jew­ish Cen­ter on 169th under the charismatic Rabbi Asher Murciano was a prominent anchor institution before it moved to Forest Hills, but there were also informal social clubs like El Filo, often geared towards people whose families were originally from Izmir or Salonika or other specific hometowns. Many in the community continued to speak not only Ladino but also Greek and Turkish, while interacting and finding common ground with the increasing number of Spanish speakers from the Caribbean who settled nearby in the Bronx.;Western Asia;Turkey, Israel;133016;Concourse;;4.083.681.600;-7.391.739.600;Medium;Historical;ladi1251;Indo-European;lad
Judeo-Spanish;Ladino;The Sephardic Jewish Center's move to 108th Street in Forest Hills in the early 1950s marked the emergence of eastern Queens as an important area of settlement for Ladino-speaking families. Though the number who speak has diminished today, the synagogue has welcome Jews from Iranian, Egyptian, Iraqi, and other Middle Eastern backgrounds and has served as the site for an annual celebration of Ladino where speakers, semi-speakers, learners, and others come together.;Western Asia;Turkey, Israel;133016;Forest Hills;;4.072.725.000;-7.384.644.400;Smallest;Residential;ladi1251;Indo-European;lad
Judeo-Spanish;Ladino;As they grew more prosperous, many Sephardic families, some moving from the nearby tenements of Brownsville, were able to buy single-family homes in an arc of Brooklyn neighborhoods stretching from New Lots to Bensonhurst. At its height in the period immediately after the Second World War, the community maintained an impressive infrastructure of syngaogues, social clubs, and charitable organizations even as the younger generation shifted to English and looked towards the Long Island suburbs. Renowned singer Victoria Hazan was one of many Ladino speakers to spend their last days at the Sephardic Home for the Aged in Bath Beach.;Western Asia;Turkey, Israel;133016;Gravesend;Bensonhurst, East New York;4.059.580.000;-7.399.723.200;Smallest;Residential;ladi1251;Indo-European;lad
Judeo-Spanish;Ladino;The earliest documented Ladino-speaking community in NYC formed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a cluster in and around Broome and Allen streets within the larger Yiddish-speaking matrix of the mostly Yiddish-speaking Lower East Side, though there were tensions with Yiddish speakers (who often questioned the Jewishness of non-Yiddish speakers). It was in this area that an active Ladino press first formed (La Vara the longest-standing publication) and that the first synagogues and social clubs for Ladino speakers took root. Many Sephardim initially left for Harlem, where a Ladino-speaking cluster formed in the 1910s and 1920s, with larger numbers moving to Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx after.;Western Asia;Turkey, Israel;133016;Lower East Side;;4.071.787.300;-7.399.131.900;Medium;Historical;ladi1251;Indo-European;lad
Juhuri;Горско-еврейский;Until recent decades, Juhuri speakers were concentrated primarily in the towns and villages on the eastern slopes of the Caucasus mountains. Today, with a global population estimated between 100-200,000, they live primarily in Israel and the U.S., although thousands remain in Dagestan and Azerbaijan. Probably several thousand strong, the Juhuri-speaking community in New York is centered in central Brooklyn around the Kavkazi Jewish Congregation (Or HaMizrekh) on Ocean Parkway. The Lezginka Dance Company, based in Brooklyn, preserves and continues community dance traditions through teaching and performance. The Juhuri (or Judeo-Tat) language is still spoken by many middle-aged and older people, who were born in the Caucasus, and is maintained in some families and some spheres of daily life, but many have switched to Russian or English, and many of the older generation also speak Azeri.

The Kirat Rai Society of America is one organization representing members of several dozen different ethnolinguistic groups of eastern Nepal considered Indigenous to the region, but not Sunwar, Limbu, or Bhutanese Rai, who have their own organizations, or Yakkha, of whom there may be a small number. Almost all groups, after centuries of pressure, are shifting to Nepali, with the largest Rai language Bantawa sometimes also serving as a kind of common language. Estimates of the New York Rai community, centered in Queens, ranged from a few hundred to as many as 1,000.

Lombard;Lombard;Despite the overwhelming presence of southerners, almost all of Italy's substantial linguistic diversity has at one time or another been represented in the New York City area. Northern Italians, especially Ligurians from Chiavari south of Genoa, but also those from Piedmont and Tuscany, were numerous among the earlier arrivals in the mid-19th century, but there also appears to have been a variety of other northerners. Relatively little is known about the trajectory of the smaller northern Italian communities, which seem to have started moving out of Little Italy already in the 1880s towards the southern section of Greenwich Village, where many worked as artisans and assimilated relatively rapidly.;Southern Europe;Italy, Switzerland;3903000;Greenwich Village;;4.072.767.900;-7.400.059.900;Small;Historical;lomb1257;Indo-European;lmo

The earliest known Naga to come to the United States was Eramo Shanjamo Jungi, who arrived in 1904 with a family of Baptist missionaries returning from Nagaland to their home in Trenton Junction.

Following the Second World War and the 1956 revolution in Hungary came a Hungarian Roma community, including many musicians.  There is no community center, according to Roma scholar Ian Hancock, but some Pentecostal churches have large Romani American congregations and a Romani-owned restaurant in the Bowery was at one point a gathering place. Later, many came to be most concentrated in Greenwich Village, with fortune telling as a major source of income.

The former has a long history in the city, originally founded in Bushwick to serve as a home to an annual folk festival, and later relocated to Long Island. The institution expanded throughout the 20th century to include a dance hall, a biergarten, and even a bowling alley, all of which have served New York's Low German speakers and their descendants.

In the city, Malayali live in all boroughs, though predominantly in eastern Queens, with Long Island's New Hyde Park, just beyond the Queens border, an important residential hub for the community. Many are medical professionals, with roughly 80% of Malayali women in New York working as nurses, according to one community member, and some communities forming near hospitals. Most Malayali in New York are Christian, congregating at churches like Williamsbridge's St. Thomas Syro Malabar and Manor Heights' Mar Gregorios Orthodox Church, and much of the community also unites annually for Onam, a harvest festival specific to the Kerala state celebrated in late August and early September.;Southern Asia;India;35495000;Williamsbridge;;4.088.377.000;-7.385.874.900;Medium;Residential;mala1464;Dravidian;mal
Maltese;Malti;The New York area is home to a significant community from the Mediterranean island nation of Malta who speak Maltese, a distinctive Semitic language with influence from Italian and other languages. Earlier community estimates for the Maltese population around New York have been as high as 20,000, with emigration peaking around the 1960s due to the island government’s encouragment and many who arrived eventually working in the city’s building-related trades. Many Maltese New Yorkers initially lived on the lower west and east sides of Manhattan, with some in Brooklyn and Astoria later a focal point. Today the Maltese Center in Astoria, the community’s last remaining kazin (club) which opened in 1982, counts approximately 200 members. Open twice a week for socializing over pastizzi at a small bar as well as outdoor bocce games next to a storied fig tree (it-tina), the Center also hosts Leyla Malti (Maltese evenings with skits and short plays) as well as language classes for both children and adults. At the Center, Maltese is still actively spoken in its many dialects, which often vary from town to town, with many from the island of Gozo and some New York-born speakers. In Astoria, the Maltese find themselves in a matrix of Italian, Arabic, and Greek influences not unlike those on their homeland.;Southern Europe;Malta;481760;Astoria;;4.077.154.900;-7.391.963.600;Medium;Residential;malt1254;Afro-Asiatic;mlt

While Bengali grows increasingly dominant as the national language, various factors have caused Indigenous people from the CHT to emigrate since the 1960s, including the construction of the Kaptai Dam, which destroyed the homes and farmland of tens of thousands, and an assimilationist political regime that favored Bengali culture and Islam. These refugees have consequently established communities in other areas of Bangladesh and overseas, and even as far as Jackson Heights, Queens, where the American Jumma Council unifies speakers of languages like Chak, Chakma, Marma, Tanchangya, and Tripuri. Fewer than 100 individuals may comprise the Jumma community in New York, most of whom arrived after 2010, practice Buddhism, and live in neighborhoods from Woodside to Jamaica.

The Mohican language, closely related to Lenape varieties, is said to have been spoken by some even after the displacement of most Mohicans to the west. Today, the Stockbridge-Munsee Mohican Tribe is in Wisconsin, where some are working to revive the language, as are a group in northwest Connecticut associated with the Schaghticoke Indian Reservation continuing to struggle for recognition. Mohican should not be confused with Mohegan, which remained in use further east in Connecticut until the passing of the remarkable Fidelia Fielding, the last native speaker, in 1908.

Other community members cite educational opportunities as their motivation for immigrating. The vast majority of Burmese in Myanmar are Buddhist, and there are many ethnic Burmans and other Myanmar Buddhists who gather at the Buddhist temple in Brooklyn's Prospect Heights, which has a larger facility in New Jersey. Many of the Christian groups gather at Glendale's Myanmar Baptist Church. Some have found work in Manhattan's Diamond District.

Nigerian English;Pidgin;New York's Nigerian population started growing in the 1970s and 80s, accelerating since 2000 in part thanks to the Diversity Visa program. Nigerians from a wide variety of backgrounds—though a significant percentage are middle-class and highly educated— now make up a large percentage of the city's massive West African community, particularly in East New York, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Flatbush, Clifton, and Concourse. Numerous evangelical churches now serve Christian Nigerian New Yorkers, and there are a number of restaurants, markets, and other businesses for the wider community. Community and hometown organizations also represent those with ties to particular Nigerian states like Edo and Akwa Ibom. The multilingualism of Nigerian New Yorkers testifies to the country's extraordinary linguistic diversity, though Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, and Edo varieties appear to be the most common, with Nigerian English sometimes a lingua franca. Smaller language groups are also present, including some with substantial and well-organized communities: Afenmai, Anaang, Edo, Efik, Esan, Ibibio, Kalabari, Tiv, Urhobo, and likely others.;Western Africa;Nigeria;;East New York;Bedford-Stuyvesant, Flatbush;4.066.116.300;-7.387.825.200;Large;Residential;nige1257;Indo-European;eng

Northeastern Mandarin Chinese;东北话;Most Chinese speakers in the city, from the first half of the 19th century until the second half of the 20th, spoke southern Chinese varieties, notably forms of Taishanese and Cantonese, but significant numbers of speakers of northern Chinese varieties including official Mandarin, began arriving especially after the Second World War. Many were from Taiwan and established a community in and around Flushing, where other Chinese immigrants from all over gradually joined them. Today, with the largest Chinese population outside of Asia, the entire metro area is home to an extraordinary variety of Sinitic (Chinese) languages even beyond the most widely spoken (Mandarin, Cantonese, Fujianese, Taishanese, Wenzhounese, Hakka). Some represent distinct but related varieties of these (e.g. Northern Fujianese, Taiwanese, Teochew, and Hainanese are all part of the Min group, with the Fuzhou variety of Fujianese by far the most common in New York) but others are highly distinct. Reports about other smaller Chinese languages communities in the city are scarce, but within the Mandarin subgroup there seem to be substantial numbers of speakers of Northeastern Mandarin and Sichuanese, and within the Wu subgroup substantial numbers of speakers of Shanghainese and Changzhounese.

P'urhépecha;P'urhépecha;P’urhépecha is spoken by over 100,000 people in the highlands of the state of Michoacán, Mexico, making it one of the country’s largest Indigenous languages spoken outside the diverse southern states. A number of dialects have been identified, and Ethnologue distinguishes two separate languages (P’urhépecha and Western Highland P’urhépecha), but there is considerable intelligibility between almost all varieties of the languages. P’urhépecha is a language isolate, with no demonstrated connection to any other language. Michoacán remains the language's homeland, but speakers have been migrating far and wide recently in search of economic opportunity, recently arriving in significant numbers in California, Florida, and Pennsylvania. Several thousand Purehpecha speakers have come to the United States in the last three decades, primarily to Riverside County, California, parts of Florida, and the area around York, Pennsylvania, often working in agriculture. Endangered Language Alliance collaborator Alexis Paz, who is originally from Ocumicho in Michoacán and grew up in York, Pennsylvania, may be the only speaker of P'urhépecha currently in New York City.

Pa'O;ပအိုဝ်ႏ;New York's Burmese community is growing fast, particularly in areas of western Queens (Elmhurst, Woodhaven, Sunnyside, and Jackson Heights), where at least 7,000 immigrants from Myanmar currently reside, according to 2015-2019 American Community Survey data—and also southern Brooklyn. Many are Christian refugees from minority groups who fled the country's military rule and decades of civil war, as well as a reported small number Rohingya Muslims facing extreme persecution. Other community members cite educational opportunities as their motivation for immigrating. The vast majority of Burmese in Myanmar are Buddhist, and there are many ethnic Burmans and other Myanmar Buddhists who gather at the Buddhist temple in Brooklyn's Prospect Heights, which has a larger facility in New Jersey. Many of the Christian groups gather at Glendale's Myanmar Baptist Church. Some have found work in Manhattan's Diamond District. Besides Burmese (including the Dawei and Intha varieties), there are speakers of several varieties of Chin, Kachin, Karen, Lahu, Mon, Pa'O, Rakhine, Shan, and Wa, and perhaps other languages.;Southeastern Asia;Myanmar;560000;Glendale;Elmhurst;4.070.582.964;-7.387.011.545;Smallest;Community;paok1235;Sino-Tibetan;blk

Palatine German;Pälzisch;Many Protestants in the Palatinate, speaking a distinctive Germanic variety in what is today southwest Germany, were left destitute by the religious and political upheaval that tore through their home territory in the early 18th century. Thousands made their way to Rotterdam, hoping to make it to England, where Parliament had promised sanctuary and where many set up an encampment outside London. As fears of the refugees mounted, the English transported nearly 3,000 German Palatines in ten ships to New York in 1710, where they were quarantined on Governors Island in horrible conditions. Some later came to live in the city, then centered on lower Manhattan, including famed journalist John Peter Zenger, while a larger number of others went on to found farms and settlements in New York's Mohawk Valley, beside the Native Haudenosaunee people.;Western Europe;Germany, France;400000;Governors Island;;4.068.885.500;-7.401.909.200;Medium;Historical;stan1295;Indo-European;pfl

Puerto Rican Sign Language;Puerto Rican Sign Language;In his book Signing in Puerto Rican, author Andrés Torres provides an invaluable account of the Puerto Rican Deaf world in New York City in which he grew up, which he estimates as having included some 2,000 people in the mid-20th century. Torres reports the use at different points of home signs that evolved in his own family as well as Sign English and some ASL, of which Puerto Rican Sign Language (PRSL) is sometimes considered a close variant. Deaf schools, migration, social change, and other factors all contributed to a fluid multilingual situation. The extent to which a distinctive PRSL has been and is being used in New York is not certain, but the Puerto Rican Society of Catholic Deaf has been a focal point for the community for over 60 years.;Caribbean;United States;;Upper East Side;;4.078.248.766;-7.395.650.447;Smallest;Community;puer1237;;psl

Ramaluk;ར་མ་ལུག་སྐད་;"Ramaluk (ra-ma-lug skad​), literally “half-goat half-sheep” (language), is the informal term employed by Tibetans to refer to a range of different code-mixing practices, which may serve as a lingua franca for people from across the Himalaya. In New York, this most typically refers to mixing between Tibetan varieties and Nepali, as most ethnic Tibetans come to the city by way of Nepal, but as noted by Tournadre (2003), this term is also in wide use on the other side of the Nepali border to refer to code-mixing practices involving Tibetan and Chinese. The goat and sheep of the ​Ramaluk​ label signify hybridity but are variables that can stand for any language, lending even more ambiguity to the project of enumerating named language practices above and beyond the already difficult nature of enumerating languages themselves. Moreover, the “impure” nature of ​Ramaluk​ is seen as evidence of endangerment of Tibetan as it gives way to surrounding languages. Nepal-born individuals of Tibetan ancestry may claim to “only be able to speak ​Ramaluk as opposed to ""pure"" Tibetan.";Southern Asia;Nepal, India, China;;Jackson Heights;Elmhurst, Sunnyside, Woodside;4.074.699.277;-7.389.161.824;Large;Residential;;Sino-Tibetan;

Romani;Romani;Many of the earliest Roma communities in New York formed on the Lower East Side/East Village among other immigrant communities from Southern and Eastern Europe, and for some the city was a seasonal base. Following the Second World War and the 1956 revolution in Hungary came a Hungarian Roma community, including many musicians.  There is no community center, according to Roma scholar Ian Hancock, but some Pentecostal churches have large Romani American congregations and a Romani-owned restaurant in the Bowery was at one point a gathering place. Later, many came to be most concentrated in Greenwich Village, with fortune telling as a major source of income.

Swabian;Schwäbisch;Speakers of German language varieties were among the early colonists in New Amsterdam, but it was in the mid-19th century that New York became a German-language metropolis of tremendous scale and diversity rivaled only by Berlin and Vienna. Initially the hub was Kleindeutschland (Little Germany), today the East Village, especially in the vicinity of Tompkins Square Park. Among the largest regional linguistic groups, coming in waves after the uprisings of 1848, were the Prussians, the (Prussian-avoiding) Bavarians (including Palatines), Swabians, Wurttembergers, Hanoverians, and many others. Each group was concentrated to a degree in a different, neighboring East Side ward. There were 28 German-language newspapers around 1850, and still 12 German dailies in 1890, including some in regional languages like the Plattdeutsche Post (Low German) and Schwabbisches Wochenblatt (Swabian). The end of Kleindeutschland (Little Germany) is sometimes dated to the Slocum Disaster of 1904, in which over 1,000 people (primarily German-Americans) died, and the discrimination faced by German-Americans during the World Wars.;Western Europe;Germany;820000;East Village;;4.072.615.665;-7.398.336.473;Large;Historical;swab1242;Indo-European;swg

Tiv;Tiv;New York's Nigerian population started growing in the 1970s and 80s, accelerating since 2000 in part thanks to the Diversity Visa program. Nigerians from a wide variety of backgrounds—though a significant percentage are middle-class and highly educated— now make up a large percentage of the city's massive West African community, particularly in East New York, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Flatbush, Clifton, and Concourse. Numerous evangelical churches now serve Christian Nigerian New Yorkers, and there are a number of restaurants, markets, and other businesses for the wider community. Community and hometown organizations also represent those with ties to particular Nigerian states like Edo and Akwa Ibom. The multilingualism of Nigerian New Yorkers testifies to the country's extraordinary linguistic diversity, though Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, and Edo varieties appear to be the most common, with Nigerian English sometimes a lingua franca.

Me'phaa activist and writer Zenaida Cantú is aware of at least 50 speakers of her language now living across New York, with some 30 or so from the municipio of Malinaltepec alone, some of whom have formed a band. There may be others who speak the very different (not always mutually intelligible) varieties from Acatepec and Tlacoapa.

Tripuri;ককবরক;The Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) region of Bangladesh is home to many Indigenous groups (collectively called the Jumma), speaking at least 12 languages and practicing a number of religions, including traditional animistic religion, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Christianity, as opposed to the Islam widespread in the rest of Bangladesh. While Bengali grows increasingly dominant as the national language, various factors have caused Indigenous people from the CHT to emigrate since the 1960s, including the construction of the Kaptai Dam, which destroyed the homes and farmland of tens of thousands, and an assimilationist political regime that favored Bengali culture and Islam. These refugees have consequently established communities in other areas of Bangladesh and overseas, and even as far as Jackson Heights, Queens, where the American Jumma Council unifies speakers of languages like Chak, Chakma, Marma, Tanchangya, and Tripuri. Fewer than 100 individuals may comprise the Jumma community in New York, most of whom arrived after 2010, practice Buddhism, and live in neighborhoods from Woodside to Jamaica.

Nigerians from a wide variety of backgrounds—though a significant percentage are middle-class and highly educated— now make up a large percentage of the city's massive West African community, particularly in East New York, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Flatbush, Clifton, and Concourse. Numerous evangelical churches now serve Christian Nigerian New Yorkers, and there are a number of restaurants, markets, and other businesses for the wider community. Community and hometown organizations also represent those with ties to particular Nigerian states like Edo and Akwa Ibom. The multilingualism of Nigerian New Yorkers testifies to the country's extraordinary linguistic diversity, though Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, and Edo varieties appear to be the most common, with Nigerian English sometimes a lingua franca.

Wakhi;X̌ik;With approximately 40,000 speakers worldwide, Wakhi is a language of the Pamir mountains, spoken by small populations in adjacent, remote regions of Tajikistan, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and China. In New York, there are some six or seven Wakhi families from the Hunza area of Pakistan and a handful of Wakhis from the Pamir region of Tajikistan. All maintain some connection with the Ismaili community centered on the jamatkhana, or religious center, on Woodhaven Boulevard in Queens. Wakhi speaker Husniya Khujamyorova, originally from Murghab (Tajikistan) but now living in Brooklyn, has worked extensively on her language and other Pamiri languages with the Endangered Language Alliance since 2010, including fieldwork in New York, Tajikistan, and China.

Welsh;Cymraeg;Waves of Welsh immigration to America began in the late 18th century, driven by difficult harvests in rural areas of Wales. Though Welsh communities were more concentrated and preserved the language longer in coal-mining areas (such as in Pennsylvania), a steady influx of Welsh-speaking immigrants to New York (city and state, notably including Utica) continued through the 19th century and the Welsh newspaper 'Y Drych Americanaidd' was established in the city in 1851 (later moved to Utica). Welsh identity persists in the city today, anchored by festivals such as the annual Wales Week around St. David's Day.

Zaghawa;Beria;Following genocidal campaigns by the government-backed Janjaweed militias in Sudan in the early 2000s, hundreds of thousands of Darfuri fled to refugee camps in Chad and, when possible, elsewhere. Of the much smaller number who made it as refugees to the U.S., most settled in Iowa and Indiana, from which several hundred left for a small Darfuri enclave in the Kensington section of Brooklyn. All the dozen or so Darfuri languages are giving way to what is now called Darfuri Arabic, which was already making inroads before the killings, but has also been the principal medium of communication among all kinds of Darfuris, in the refugee camps and in exile.

Zoroastrian Dari;گویش بهدینان;Avestan is the sacred language of Zoroastrianism, which is practiced by a small community living across the New York metro region. Originally spoken around 1500 BCE and thus an important linguistic key to the Indo-European past, Avestan was revitalized as a written-only liturgical language nearly two thousand years later. Named for Zoroastrianism's central text, the Avesta, the language employed a new alphabet that descends to an extent from (Semitic) Aramaic, though linguistically it is closer to (Indo-European) Sanskrit. In daily life, Zoroastrians from Iran may speak Zoroastrian Dari (closely related to Persian), while those from South Asia (notably Parsis) may speak Gujarati or English, but Avestan continues to serve as a common liturgical language for worshippers at the Dar-e-Mehr Zoroastrian Temple in Pomona, New York.;Southern Asia;Iran;8000;Pomona (NY);;4.116.745.400;-7.405.239.300;Smallest;Community;zoro1242;Indo-European;gbz

Breton;Brezhoneg;Immigration from Brittany, the region of northwest France where this Celtic language is spoken, grew substantially in the early 20th century and reached its peak between the two world wars. During this time the majority of French immigrants in New York City may have been Breton, with several thousand having come to work at Michelin Tire Corporation's factory in Milltown, New Jersey, or otherwise after the Second World War as waiters, dishwashers, busboys etc. at restaurants which often had Breton owners. By 1967, there were 12,000 Bretons in the city, representing over a third of the city's total French population, according to the newspaper France-Amerique. The linguist Kenneth Nilsen found that a number of restaurants were mainly Breton-speaking, with many originally from the Gourin-Roudaouallec-Langonned region and some claiming to have learned French only in NYC's French restaurants. Today, the Breton Association of New York (BZH-NY) still has a large membership and continues to hold cultural events on a regular basis. A newer organization, Breizh Amerika, builds transnational ties between Bretons in Brittany and those in the city, who now number 2-3,000 at most according to the organization's founder Charles Kergaravat.

Ningbo;宁波话;Most Chinese speakers in the city, from the first half of the 19th century until the second half of the 20th, spoke southern Chinese varieties, notably forms of Taishanese and Cantonese, but significant numbers of speakers of northern Chinese varieties including official Mandarin, began arriving especially after the Second World War. Many were from Taiwan and established a community in and around Flushing, where other Chinese immigrants from all over gradually joined them. Today, with the largest Chinese population outside of Asia, the entire metro area is home to an extraordinary variety of Sinitic (Chinese) languages even beyond the most widely spoken (Mandarin, Cantonese, Fujianese, Taishanese, Wenzhounese, Hakka). Some represent distinct but related varieties of these (e.g. Northern Fujianese, Taiwanese, Teochew, and Hainanese are all part of the Min group, with the Fuzhou variety of Fujianese by far the most common in New York) but others are highly distinct. Reports about other smaller Chinese languages communities in the city are scarce, but within the Mandarin subgroup there seem to be substantial numbers of speakers of Northeastern Mandarin and Sichuanese, and within the Wu subgroup substantial numbers of speakers of Shanghainese and Changzhounese.

This community, at one time the third largest Norwegian-speaking city in the world after Oslo and Bergen, Norway, had grown into a city unto itself with a full range of institutions and services, centered in Sunset Park and Bay Ridge. The decline of shipping and the Great Depression caused hundreds of Norwegian sailors to seek shelter in makeshift shacks in the rubble of a dump in Red Hook, known by some as ""Ørkenen Sur"" (Bitter Desert) and knocked down in 1934 to make way for the current athletic fields.

Tanchangya;𑄖𑄧𑄐𑄴𑄌𑄧𑄁𑄉𑄴𑄡;The Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) region of Bangladesh is home to many Indigenous groups (collectively called the Jumma), speaking at least 12 languages and practicing a number of religions, including traditional animistic religion, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Christianity, as opposed to the Islam widespread in the rest of Bangladesh. While Bengali grows increasingly dominant as the national language, various factors have caused Indigenous people from the CHT to emigrate since the 1960s, including the construction of the Kaptai Dam, which destroyed the homes and farmland of tens of thousands, and an assimilationist political regime that favored Bengali culture and Islam. These refugees have consequently established communities in other areas of Bangladesh and overseas, and even as far as Jackson Heights, Queens, where the American Jumma Council unifies speakers of languages like Chak, Chakma, Marma, Tanchangya, and Tripuri. Fewer than 100 individuals may comprise the Jumma community in New York, most of whom arrived after 2010, practice Buddhism, and live in neighborhoods from Woodside to Jamaica.

North Frisian;Fering;North and West Frisian speakers were among the earliest settlers in the colony of New Amsterdam, possibly constituting, according to one source, the single largest ethnic group in the multicultural mix of early New Amsterdam. Peter Stuyvesant himself, the famous director general of the colony from 1647 to 1664, was born and raised in Friesland (part of the Dutch Republic) and would have been familiar with West Frisian. Others like Brooklyn settler Pieter Claessen (Wyckoff) were North Frisians. Frisian immigration resumed on a significant scale in the 19th century, with most going to the Midwest, but many West Frisians also passed through or stayed in New York or Paterson, New Jersey, forming social organizations with some ties to the Dutch-speaking community. North Frisians (more tied to the German community) came in large numbers to Brooklyn from the islands of Föhr and Amrum—1,500 Föhrer before 1929, for instance, who mostly spoke Fering and founded an association later headquartered in Valley Stream. Today, West Frisian is an official national language of the Netherlands along with Dutch and remains vital in its home territory, but North Frisian and Saterland Frisian, minority languages within Germany, have much smaller numbers of speakers.
